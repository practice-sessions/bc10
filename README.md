# README

This project is a training pilot project, will be done in Ruby on Rails.

All contributors are obliged to open features branch on their local repos (on your local pc/laptop/workstation), and push in the name of the featues branch you have created locally.

A named team member will then be tasked with reviewing the code and, if all is clear (no merge conflicts), the feature branch will then be merged into 'development' branch.

Please DO NOT push directly into master branch. In other words, DO NOT do a git PUSH origin MASTER.
